## A Passionate Software Engineer & Backend Specialist

Hello, I'm a Software Engineer with over 20 years of full-stack engineering experience, specializing in backend development and API architecture. My career has been defined by a relentless pursuit of building robust, scalable, and efficient systems, with a deep focus on Microsoft technologies like C#, .NET Core, and Azure.

## My Expertise
My core strength lies in designing and implementing enterprise-grade backend systems and APIs that power seamless, high-performance applications. I thrive on crafting clean, maintainable code and architecting APIs that are intuitive, secure, and scalable. With hands-on expertise in .NET Core and Azure, I’ve built solutions that handle complex business logic, integrate with cloud services, and ensure reliability at scale.

Whether it’s optimizing database interactions, streamlining microservices, or securing API endpoints, I’m passionate about solving technical challenges with precision and foresight. My work spans industries, from finance to healthcare, delivering systems that meet rigorous enterprise demands.

## Global Teams
Beyond coding, I have a proven track record of working with distributed teams across geographies, including China, India, and the U.S. I excel at coordinating cross-functional teams, fostering collaboration, and ensuring alignment on project goals. 

With experience managing projects from ideation to deployment, I bring a strategic mindset to every initiative, balancing technical excellence with business objectives. My ability to bridge cultural and time-zone gaps ensures smooth communication and efficient workflows, no matter where my team is located.

## My Approach
I believe in writing code that’s not just functional but elegant—code that’s easy to maintain, test, and scale. I’m driven by a commitment to quality, leveraging best practices like CI/CD, automated testing, and modular design. My knack for anticipating challenges allows me to resolve issues before they escalate, keeping projects on track and teams productive.

Whether I’m architecting a new API, optimizing a legacy system, or mentoring a junior developer, my goal is always the same: deliver solutions that make a meaningful impact.
