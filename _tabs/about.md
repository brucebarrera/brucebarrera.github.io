## A Passionate Software Engineer & Backend Specialist

Hello, I'm **Bruce Barrera**, a Software Engineer with over 20 years of full-stack engineering experience, specializing in backend development and API architecture. My career has been defined by a relentless pursuit of building robust, scalable, and efficient systems, with a deep focus on Microsoft technologies like C#, .NET Core, and Azure.

## My Expertise
My core competency is building and implementing enterprise-grade backend systems and APIs that power seamless, high-performance applications. I am skilled at writing clean, readable code and architecting APIs that are intuitive, secure, and scalable. With hands-on experience with .NET Core and Azure, I've built solutions that handle complex business logic, integrate with cloud services, and remain reliable at scale.

Whether it’s optimizing database interactions, streamlining microservices, or securing API endpoints, I’m passionate about solving technical challenges with precision and foresight. My work spans industries, from finance to healthcare, delivering systems that meet rigorous enterprise demands.

## Global Teams
Besides coding, I have a proven track record of working with distributed teams across geographies, including China, India, and the U.S. I excel at leading cross-functional teams, developing collaboration and driving alignment on project goals.

Having managed projects from conception through deployment, I take a strategic view of every project, balancing technical excellence with business requirements. My ability to work across cultural and time-zone divides ensures painless communication and smooth workflows, irrespective of my team's location.

## My Approach
I believe in writing code that’s not just functional but elegant—code that’s easy to maintain, test, and scale. I’m driven by a commitment to quality, leveraging best practices like CI/CD, automated testing, and modular design. My knack for anticipating challenges allows me to resolve issues before they escalate, keeping projects on track and teams productive.

Whether I’m architecting a new API, optimizing a legacy system, or mentoring a junior developer, my goal is always the same: deliver solutions that make a meaningful impact.
